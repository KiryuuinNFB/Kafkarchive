        <div class="walloftext">
            <p>1.The curly braces in JavaScript code are clearly a symbol of heteronormativity, as they form a straight line, completely excluding the possibility of any queer curves.</p>
            <p>2.JavaScript's built-in functions, like "parseFloat" and "parseInt," show a clear bias against non-binary identities. What about "parseOther" or "parseGenderqueer"?</p>
            <p>3.The fact that JavaScript can use "&&" and "||" symbols to represent "and" and "or" operations is an obvious nod to the binary gender system. What about "|||" or "&&&" for non-binary people?</p>
            <p>4.The "switch" statement in JavaScript suggests that people's gender identity is something that can be turned on and off like a light switch. This is highly offensive and dismissive of the struggles that LGBTQ+ individuals face.</p>
            <p>5.The use of the term "prototype" in JavaScript object-oriented programming is clearly a reference to traditional gender roles, where women are expected to be the prototype of a domesticated housewife.</p>
            <p>6.The concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript implies that some identities are higher or more valuable than others. This is a blatant display of hierarchical thinking and discrimination.</p>
            <p>7.The "typeof" operator in JavaScript implies that identities can be neatly categorized and labeled, erasing the complexity and fluidity of human experience.</p>
            <p>8.The use of "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript suggests that LGBTQ+ identities are somehow lacking or incomplete. This is a harmful and stigmatizing message.</p>
            <p>9.The concept of "truthy" and "falsy" values in JavaScript suggests that some identities are inherently true or false, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and prejudices.</p>
            <p>10.The fact that JavaScript is often abbreviated as "JS" is clearly a reference to the discriminatory term "junk science," which has historically been used to discredit research on LGBTQ+ issues.</p>
