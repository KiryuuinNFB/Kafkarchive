# Kafkarchive

Kafkarchive is a website that contains user uploaded Honkai: Star Rail character builds and a build calculator.

It's literally a school project what do you expect.

This might be a controversial decision from me but using AI assistance is now **allowed**

As of now I am currently working on the build calculator. While it is not the main feature of the site.
It is easier to make and will make me familiar with the game mechanics more.

## Currently doing

- Making the build calculator work
- Designing the website
- Spaghetti JavaScript programming

## Will be doing later

- The mobile layout (***very important please don't forget***)
- The builds database system
- The tags database system
- The user database system
- UI Scaling
- Making the site user friendly
